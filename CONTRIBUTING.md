## Getting Started
To do anything interesting with this project, you'll need a network-connected Raspberry Pi running [WebIOPi](http://webiopi.trouch.com/INSTALL.html). Once you have that up and running on your Raspberry Pi, start by running the [Example app](https://github.com/ioveracker/WebIOPiSwift/tree/master/Example). Connecting to your Raspberry Pi to see how things work and go from there. Happy hacking!
